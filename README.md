## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

NOTE: we would recommend creating a python environment (run "venv "env name" ") and installing the dependencies by running 
"pip install -r requirements.txt"

* 1.Clone this repository in a new folder.
* 2.Create a python virtual environment (optional- provided that you have the exact/compatible versions of the libraries required).
* 2.Run api.py in terminal of your respective operating system.
* 3.Select a recorded vedio of a traffic scene from the form displayed and click submit.

## Built With

* [Python3.7](https://www.python.org/) -One of the most popular programming language
* [OpenCV(V 4.5.2.54](https://opencv.org/) - Open Source Computer Vision Library
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) -Used for making an API to feed frames of the vedio to liscence plate detection algorithm.
